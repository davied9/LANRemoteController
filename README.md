Remote controller for LAN

# Description
Remote controller for LAN, based on [kivy UI framework](https://github.com/kivy/kivy).

Basic implement thought :
- Client : Send key combination information in LAN
- Server : Explain key combination information and excute key combinations
    
    
Things will work on all kinds of devices involved with keyboard, thanks to SavinaRoja/PyUserInput.
