Remote controller for LAN

# Description
Remote controller for LAN, based on [kivy](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) and [PyUserInput](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput) .

Basic implement thought :

- Server : Explain key combination information and excute key combinations
    
    
Things will work on all kinds of devices involved with keyboard.
